# batsrus-userproblems

User problems to use with the [BATS-R-US](https://github.com/SWMFsoftware/BATSRUS)
code, version 9.20 (release 2018). Problems encompass single-fluid, multi-species radiation-(M)HD and multi-fluid radiation-(M)HD setups.

Additional code source files are included with modifications to output extra variables in the TecPlot I/O and to perform the plane-parallel ray-tracing calculation.

The problems only work with the 2018 release of BATS-R-US. Development had been started to port it to more recent version of the code, but this is unfinished work. Installation and compilation of the MHD source code can be read in the corresponding documentation. The latter documentation also explains how to setup a user problem as provided here.
